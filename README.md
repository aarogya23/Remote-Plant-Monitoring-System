🌱 Remote Plant Monitoring System
📌 Project Overview

The Remote Plant Monitoring System is an IoT-based smart agriculture project designed to monitor plant health and automate irrigation remotely.

The system collects environmental and soil data using multiple sensors and automatically controls the water motor using a relay module.

🎯 Objectives

Monitor temperature and humidity using DHT11

Measure soil moisture level

Detect soil nutrients (NPK)

Monitor soil pH level

Detect fire hazards

Automatically control water motor

Display real-time data on LED display

Enable remote monitoring (IoT-based)
